    	<h1>Hi, I'm Meredith!</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I hope you found the experience of browsing my works is enjoyable. </p>

        <p>Here you can find the projects I feel most proud of, and also some of my process blogs and visual journals in my blog. I doodled some selfies here to make it more interesting. Hope you like them. </p>

        <h1 class="dividep"><img id="profilepic" src="images/header/Untitled-7.png" width="100%"></img>When I am not working,</h1>

        <p>I might be watching anime. I started watching anime when I was 8, and I learned how to speak Japanese (though I'm not a master) when I was around 14. Besides anime, I watch tons of shows like The Big Bang Theory, Downton Abbey, Grey's Anatomy, Friends, Fringe, How I Met Your Mother, and more. </p>

        <p>I also love traveling. I have been to so many different places, Japan, UK, China, etc. recently picked up a hobby of documenting of experiences abroad in the form of visual journal. They are available in my blog. Feel free to check them out! Btw, they are mostly food. <br>I LOVE FOOD. </p>

        <img id="profilepic" src="images/header/Untitled-8.png" width="100%">

        <p>Working out is big part of my life. I go to gym almost everyday. </p>
        <p>I started my crazy diet life when I was 17. I thought of myself being "fat", thought I was not. I was 5'2 and about 106 lbs, size 0. However, I was so sure that I was too heavy and I went on crazy diet: 3 apples a day for a week in a row, or 21 days with only water and black coffee. I got so depressed by those crazy diet, and I felt I can never be happy again.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, working out brought me out of the shadow of being on diet. The first time of running was, of course, horrible, but I got the hang of it after several weeks. Because of long distance running, I started to feel better about myself and stopped being on crazy unhealthy diet. I ate balaced meals and rest well, and of course, run, run, run. </p>
        <p>Now I am 21, still 5'2 and 106 lbs. I am still running.</p>
        <p>This is how I do things. I decided to do it, then I don't give up. I just do it. Right before I started to run the first time, I had never run more than 10 mins in my entire life. I told myself "Unless I am about to throw up or pass out, don't stop!". I am a tough cookie. I don't give up. I don't stop.</p>

        <h1 class="dividep"><img id="profilepic" src="images/header/Untitled-5.png" width="100%"></img>My working experience</h1>

        <p>Here is my <a href="images/resume_Meredith_Yuhan_Xie.pdf"><Strong>RESUME</Strong></a>!</p>

        <p>I am the lead designer in the projects High Speed Railway System Design and FriendME, which are available in my portfolio. I am extremely passionate about design, that I can barely stop once I start it.  </p>
        
        <p>Besides working in those projects, I had a pleasant internship experiences at Baidu,Inc headquarter, Beijing.</p>

        <p>In the summer 2015, I interned in Communication and Design Lab, Hunan University, where I worked on projects that highly focused on User Interface Design and Visual Motion Design. Due to disclosure condition, I cannot tell you what I did in detail, but I can tell you what I learned. I got really fimiliar with Adobe Creative Cloud tools, especially Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. I also worked in Sketch while I was developing high fedelity UI prototype.</p>

        <h1 class="dividep"><img id="profilepic" src="images/header/Untitled-6.png" width="100%"> Looking for internship and full-time job opportunities.</h1>

        <p>Email: yuhan8@uw.edu<br>Phone number: (206)747-3666 </p>
        <p> I am currently looking for internship and full-time opportunities in the field of UX and Design.</p>
        
        <p>I am now a senior in University of Washington, Seattle Campus, majoring in Human Centered Design and Engineering, focusing on Human Computer Interaction. I am more eagerly looking for an internship opportunity in Summer 2017. However, since there is also a great chance of me earning a master's degree in HCDE Program, my expected graduation date range widely from June, 2017 to 2018. </p>

        <p>My interest of my career is mainly in design. I am especially interested in User Experience Design and interaction design, though I am willing to working on projects that involves user research, usability test and front-end develop as well. I am active in the Greater Seattle area. Feel free to shoot me an email or a text to meet me if you have a job opportunity available if you want. </p>
